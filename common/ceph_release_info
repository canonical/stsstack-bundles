# Series & Release Info (see http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/releases/)

# Note: If a Ceph version is used by multiple releases, it should be listed
# against the first release that used it. The get_app_release_name function
# sorts the list of releases and does a ">" comparison and will use it for
# newer versions. This may break when the Ubuntu release name wraps past Z.
