# This file contains ubuntu series names along with their openstack
# counterpart release names. Each stable release of Ubuntu has a
# contemporaneous release of Openstack shipped in its main archives. Each LTS
# release of Ubuntu has the ability to install Openstack releases from between
# LTS releases by using the Ubuntu Cloud Archive. Each cloud archive release
# corresponds back to a release avaiable in a stable release of Ubuntu.
#
# More info on releases at https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle

# TODO: keep this list up-to-date with supported series in order have a way to
