# SAML

## Post-deployment instructions

The setup provided by the `keystone-saml` overlay makes use of the `https://samltest.id` service which is a mock service for testing SAML authentication.

Once the deployment has been completed (all keystone units are in ready state), please run through the following script:

```console
./tools/enable_samltestid.sh
```
